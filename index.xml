      <description>You do not truly understand a topic unless you can explain it to somebody else.
What is Exercism Exercism is a platform where people can learn programming languages.
What is it for: learning programming languages quick, easy, hands-on and right.
How does it work:
 you have instruction how to set up the environment you have simple exercise you have unit tests you run a unit test: it fails you google some basics: make the test pass repeat previous two steps until all provided unit tests pass  Then is the fun part: you push it to the platform (submit) and a living person with relevant experience, called mentor looks at what you have done and gives you feedback!</description>
